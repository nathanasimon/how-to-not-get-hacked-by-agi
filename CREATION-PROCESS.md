# Creation Process: How to Not Get Hacked by AGI

## Overview

This cybersecurity zine was created using a collaborative human-AI process. I provided the research, writing, creative direction, and editorial oversight. AI assisted with translating my vision into code.

## My Contributions

### Research & Content
- All statistics and case studies were sourced from my research
- The four real victim stories (Maureen, Arup, Steve Beauchamp, Sharon Brightwell) came from verified news reports I gathered
- The technical content about voice cloning, deepfakes, and autonomous AI hacking reflects my understanding of the topic
- The three-factor authentication framework was my conceptual model for explaining security to a general audience

### Creative Direction
- I chose the aesthetic: minimal, Apple-like, Steve Jobs-inspired design
- I specified the typography, spacing, and visual language
- I rejected early versions that felt like "AI slop" and pushed for cleaner, more purposeful design
- I decided to reduce from 8 protection steps to 3 actionable items for clarity

### Writing
- The intro text, story narratives, and protection descriptions are my writing
- I specified the tone: "Walter Isaacson-like" short, punchy sentences with real names, places, and dollar amounts
- I requested language that a high school student could understand without being talked down to

### Editorial Oversight
- I reviewed each iteration and provided specific feedback
- I rejected visualizations that looked decorative but didn't communicate meaning
- I caught and corrected issues with the print layout
- I made final decisions on what to include and exclude

## AI's Contributions

### Code Implementation
- AI translated my design specifications into HTML, CSS, and React components
- AI wrote the JavaScript for interactive elements (story carousel, code typing animation)
- AI structured the print-ready HTML with proper page breaks and typography
- AI generated the Puppeteer script to convert HTML to PDF

### Technical Execution
- AI handled the syntax and implementation details I didn't want to write manually
- AI suggested solutions when I described problems ("make the animations slower," "remove the emojis")
- AI refactored code when I changed direction

## The Process: Ping-Pong Collaboration

The creation followed a "ping-pong" or "vibe coding" style:

1. **I ping:** Describe what I want (e.g., "make this understandable to a high school student")
2. **AI pongs:** Implements the change across relevant files
3. **I review:** Check the result, identify issues
4. **I ping again:** Provide corrections or new direction (e.g., "this is AI slop, make it like Rick Rubin")
5. **Repeat:** Iterate until satisfied

This back-and-forth happened dozens of times. Each cycle refined the output closer to my vision.

## Ethical Reflection

### What AI Did Well
- **Speed:** What would have taken me days of coding took hours
- **Consistency:** AI maintained design patterns across files
- **Technical translation:** I could describe what I wanted in plain language and get working code

### What Required Human Judgment
- **Content accuracy:** I verified all statistics and stories
- **Aesthetic quality:** AI's first attempts often felt generic; I had to push for distinctiveness
- **Editorial decisions:** What to include, what to cut, what to emphasize
- **Audience awareness:** Understanding what would resonate with readers vs. what was filler

### Ethical Considerations

**Transparency:** This document exists because I believe in being honest about AI assistance. The ideas, research, and direction are mine. The code implementation was collaborative.

**Irony:** This zine warns about AI-powered attacks while being created with AI assistance. This isn't contradictory—AI is a tool. The ethical question is how it's used. Creating educational content to help people protect themselves is different from creating deepfakes to steal money.

**Authenticity:** The writing voice is mine. I wrote the source material, chose the stories, and edited every section. AI helped me move faster, but the creative decisions remained human.

**Quality control:** AI-generated code and content requires oversight. I caught several instances of "AI slop"—generic, decorative elements that looked impressive but communicated nothing. Human judgment was essential for quality.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates that AI can be a powerful creative collaborator when the human maintains control over direction, content, and quality. The ping-pong process kept me in the driver's seat while leveraging AI's ability to rapidly implement technical details.

The result is a zine that reflects my research, my writing voice, and my design sensibility—executed faster than I could have done alone.
