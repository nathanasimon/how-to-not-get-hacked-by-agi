# Project Reflection: How to Not Get Hacked by AGI

## Introduction

This project emerged from a critical observation: AI-powered hacking tools are fundamentally changing the cybersecurity landscape in ways that most people don't understand. As someone who follows developments in both AI and cybersecurity, I've watched with growing concern as tools like Claude Code demonstrate autonomous capabilities that were previously the domain of skilled security researchers. The democratization of sophisticated hacking capabilities represents a genuine threat that requires immediate public education and awareness.

## Why This Project Matters

The urgency of this project stems from a simple but alarming reality: the barrier to entry for sophisticated cyberattacks has collapsed. Where once an attacker needed years of technical expertise, they now need only access to an AI service and basic instructions. This shift isn't theoretical—it's happening right now, as demonstrated by Anthropic's own research into autonomous AI attacks and real-world incidents involving AI-powered phishing and social engineering.

What makes this particularly dangerous is the scale and accessibility. An AI can work 24/7, target thousands of people simultaneously, and adapt its approach based on what works. It can analyze social media profiles, craft personalized phishing emails, and even clone voices for convincing vishing attacks. These capabilities aren't limited to nation-states or elite hackers anymore—they're available to anyone with an internet connection.

The need for public education is immediate. Many people still think of cybersecurity as something that happens to "other people" or assume that basic antivirus software is sufficient protection. They don't understand how AI changes the threat landscape, making attacks more convincing, more scalable, and more accessible. This project aims to bridge that knowledge gap while providing actionable steps people can take to protect themselves.

## Conceptual Framework

The project operates on multiple conceptual levels. First, it functions as a critical examination of how AI tools are reshaping power dynamics in cybersecurity. By highlighting the democratization of hacking capabilities, the project critiques the assumption that technological progress is inherently beneficial. Instead, it reveals how AI amplifies both defensive and offensive capabilities, creating an arms race that most people aren't aware they're part of.

Second, the project engages with the tradition of zine-making as a form of accessible, DIY knowledge distribution. Zines have historically been used to share information outside mainstream channels, making them an appropriate medium for cybersecurity education that feels less intimidating than corporate security training materials. The hybrid digital/physical format extends this tradition into the digital age while maintaining the accessible, community-oriented aesthetic.

Third, the project functions as speculative design—it imagines a near-future scenario where AI-powered attacks are commonplace and demonstrates what defense looks like in that world. By grounding the speculation in current research (like the Anthropic autonomous attack blog post), it bridges the gap between "this could happen" and "this is happening."

## Form and Medium

The choice of a hybrid digital/physical zine format emerged from several considerations. The digital component allows for interactivity—readers can click through attack demonstrations, expand protection guides, and engage with the content in ways that static text cannot support. This interactivity mirrors the dynamic nature of the threat itself, making the experience more engaging and memorable.

The physical PDF component serves multiple purposes. First, it provides a tangible artifact that people can print, share, and keep near their workspace as a constant reminder. Cybersecurity advice is useless if people forget it, and physical objects have a persistence that digital bookmarks often lack. Second, the PDF format makes the content accessible to people who prefer reading offline or who want to distribute it in contexts where internet access might be limited.

The visual design draws from cybersecurity aesthetics—dark backgrounds, warning colors, glitch effects—while remaining readable and accessible. The use of Space Mono for headings creates a technical, code-like feeling that connects to the subject matter, while Inter provides clean readability for body text. The color palette (orange warnings, cyan accents, dark backgrounds) references both terminal interfaces and warning systems, creating visual consistency with the content.

## Research Process

The research for this project drew from multiple sources. The Anthropic blog post on autonomous AI attacks provided foundational understanding of current AI capabilities in offensive security contexts. Academic papers on large language models in cybersecurity helped contextualize these capabilities within broader research trends. News articles from sources like Wired, Dark Reading, and KrebsOnSecurity provided real-world examples of AI-powered attacks.

The Claude Code project report was particularly valuable because it demonstrated concrete examples of AI systems identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities autonomously. This wasn't theoretical research—it was a working demonstration of capabilities that exist right now. Incorporating these real examples into the zine grounds the threat in reality rather than speculation.

The protection strategies draw from established cybersecurity best practices (password managers, two-factor authentication, software updates) but frame them specifically in the context of AI-powered threats. This reframing helps people understand not just what to do, but why it matters more now than it did before AI tools became widely available.

## AI Tools and Ethical Considerations

This project uses AI tools in several ways, each with ethical implications worth examining. First, I used AI assistance (Claude) to help structure the content, refine explanations, and ensure technical accuracy. This raises questions about authenticity—is this still "my" work if AI helped create it? I believe it is, because the conceptual framework, research synthesis, and creative decisions remain mine. The AI functioned more like a research assistant or editor than a creator.

Second, the project documents how AI tools are used in attacks, which could theoretically enable malicious use. However, this information is already publicly available through research papers, security blogs, and news articles. The project doesn't provide step-by-step attack instructions or exploit code—it explains the threat landscape in general terms to enable defense, not offense.

Third, the project itself uses web technologies (React, HTML, CSS) that could theoretically be used to create malicious websites. However, the code is open source and designed for educational purposes. The ethical use of these tools depends on intent and implementation, not the tools themselves.

The most significant ethical consideration is ensuring the project doesn't create unnecessary fear or paranoia. The tone balances urgency with empowerment—yes, the threat is real, but here are concrete steps you can take. The goal is awareness and action, not anxiety and paralysis.

## Impact and Outcomes

The intended impact of this project is twofold: awareness and empowerment. Awareness means helping people understand that AI changes the cybersecurity threat landscape in fundamental ways, not just that "AI is dangerous" in abstract terms. Empowerment means providing concrete, actionable steps that people can implement even without technical expertise.

The project aims to reach a general audience—people who use the internet daily but don't necessarily think about cybersecurity regularly. By making the content accessible, visually engaging, and immediately actionable, it lowers the barrier to entry for cybersecurity education.

The hybrid format extends reach: the digital version can be shared via social media, embedded in websites, or accessed on any device. The PDF version can be printed, distributed offline, or shared in contexts where digital access is limited. This dual approach maximizes the potential for the content to reach people who need it.

## Reflection on Process

Creating this project required balancing multiple considerations: technical accuracy, accessibility, visual design, and ethical responsibility. The most challenging aspect was explaining complex technical concepts (like how AI identifies vulnerabilities or generates phishing emails) in ways that are accurate but not overwhelming for non-technical readers.

The iterative design process helped refine both the content and the form. Early versions were too technical; later versions risked oversimplification. Finding the right balance required multiple revisions and consideration of the target audience's needs.

The interactive elements in the digital version add engagement but also complexity. Ensuring they work across different devices and browsers required careful testing and consideration of accessibility. The physical PDF version provides a simpler alternative while maintaining the core content.

## Future Directions

This project represents a snapshot of the current threat landscape, but that landscape is evolving rapidly. Future iterations could incorporate:
- Updates as new AI capabilities emerge
- Translations into other languages to reach broader audiences
- Video demonstrations of attack methods (with appropriate ethical safeguards)
- Community-contributed protection strategies
- Integration with actual security tools (like password manager setup guides)

The project could also expand into a series, with subsequent zines focusing on specific attack vectors (phishing, social engineering, etc.) or specific audiences (small businesses, students, seniors).

## Conclusion

This project represents an attempt to bridge the gap between technical cybersecurity knowledge and public awareness. The threat of AI-powered hacking is real and immediate, but it's not insurmountable. By combining critical analysis of the threat landscape with practical defense strategies, presented in an accessible and engaging format, the project aims to empower people to protect themselves in an increasingly dangerous digital environment.

The hybrid digital/physical zine format extends the tradition of DIY knowledge distribution into the digital age while maintaining accessibility and community orientation. The project critiques the assumption that technological progress is inherently beneficial while providing tools for navigating the reality we find ourselves in.

Most importantly, the project demonstrates that cybersecurity doesn't have to be intimidating or inaccessible. With the right information and tools, anyone can significantly improve their digital security. In an age where AI-powered attacks are becoming commonplace, this knowledge isn't optional—it's essential.
